Great work, Space Voyager! We're almost finished with our journey for this 
lesson. Your mission is to create a `SocialMediaFeed` component from scratch. 
It should fetch posts from the URL https://api-regional.codesignalcontent.com/posting-application-2/posts/ and display each post's text and likes count. 
Remember to use Axios to fetch data and store the results in the state.
