# Problem
Space Explorer, we've received a chunk of code that fetches posts from a social 
media platform, but something isn't quite right. The posts should be displayed 
when the data is fetched, but instead, they're hiding in the cosmos. Can you 
debug this issue and make them visible?

// Expected JSON response format:
// [
//   {
//     "id": "412e7655-bcec-44cb-bdf1-9439c357ed04",
//     "text": "It's LeviOsa, Not LeviosAr.",
//     "authorId": "a9f39c40-b073-11ec-b909-0242ac120002",
//     "likesCount": 19
//   },
//   ... more posts ...
// ]
