# Problem
Galactic Pioneer, it's time to put our knowledge to the test by building our 
robot from scratch! We'll create a small React application comprised of multiple components, each representing a different part of the robot. Remember, each part 
should indicate what it is made of. Let's get to work and bring our React robot 
to life!
