# Problem
Stellar Navigator, let's enhance our CartContext! Add a new piece of state 
called `isCartOpen` using the `useState` hook, initialized with `false`. Then, 
provide `isCartOpen` and its updater function `setIsCartOpen` through the 
`CartContext`. This way, we can track whether our cart is open or closed.
