/*
Excellent progress, Space Voyager! Your current app tracks the number of hits 
on an alien. Now, can you adjust the starting number of hits to 5 instead of 0? 
This will simulate a scenario in which the game begins with a few hits already 
scored. Take a leap into state management with useState!
