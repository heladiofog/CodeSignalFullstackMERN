# Problem
Space Voyager, we've encountered a glitch in our route path to the planets! Run 
the code, and you'll see it doesn't lead us to where we're supposed to go. Fix 
the route so we can land on the correct planetary pages, and remember, the URL 
should reflect the name of the planet we're exploring. Happy debugging!
