# Problem
Stellar Navigator, you're doing great! Let's refine our space gallery navigation. 
Instead of having separate `star-exhibits` and `galaxy-info` paths, create a unified 
`exhibits` path with nested routes for stars and galaxies. Update the `Route` paths 
in the `AppRouter` accordingly. Happy coding!
