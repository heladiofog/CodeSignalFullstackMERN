Galactic Pioneer, your mission is to ensure that the Home Office Setup webpage 
looks great on all devices. There's a slight hiccup in the code that affects how 
items are displayed on large screens. Can you identify and fix the glitch so 
that the desk items align nicely side by side when viewed on desktops?
