<!--
Ready for the grand finale, Space Voyager? It's time to craft a sleek web 
layout, fit for any cosmic device! Your mission: code the responsive design 
from scratch using HTML and CSS techniques learned thus far. Create a layout 
for a Home Office Setup webpage that adapts seamlessly from small mobile 
screens to large desktop views. Create two divs, one with a class main-content 
and content Main Content: Tips for Home Office, and the other with a class 
sidebar and content Sidebar: More Articles. Color the divisions and use a media 
query to apply different colors for devices with a screen width of at least 
400px. May your code be as fluid as space itself!
