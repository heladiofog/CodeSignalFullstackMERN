<!--
Space Voyager, you've orbited enough around the basics of CSS. Now, prepare to launch your own space-themed webpage. Your mission is to write from scratch, using the skills you've learned, to create a cosmic experience. Make a <div> having the class attribute equal to stars, that represents the stars, complete with a styled heading and paragraphs. Add style for your stars div through the class selector, setting background color black and text color white. Color the h1 element orange to make it stand out in your space-themed page. Color one of the paragraphs yellow and make it italic to look fitting in the cosmic surroundings. Time for a full blast-off!
