<!--
Stellar work, Space Voyager! I've set up a webpage to toggle between Day and 
Night modes, but it is not working well. Sometimes, it moves the text up in the 
screen. Can you help identify the issue and fix it so that our Space Museum can 
experience both Day and Night modes without any side-effect? Remember, the 
solution is right in front of you â€” it's just one step away!
