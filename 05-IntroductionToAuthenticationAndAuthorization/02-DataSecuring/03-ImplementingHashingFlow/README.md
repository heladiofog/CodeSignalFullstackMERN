# Problem
Alrighty, it's time to exercise your coding muscles again! In this practice task, I want you to secure the launch sequence of our Library System Management. We've added some safety nets by handling errors and securing passwords. However, there's still a piece missing in the server â€” the route handler that is responsible for hashing user passwords.

Your job is to create a hash of the user's password within the route handler where we handle the creation of new accounts or the authentication of existing users. This step is critical in ensuring that the application is secure and that user credentials are protected.
