/**
 * Great work, Stellar Navigator! Now, let's try something different. In the 
 * code I provided, you see how we log a math operation to the console. Change 
 * the multiplication * operator to a division / operator instead to see how we 
 * divide numbers in JavaScript.
 */

// This is a short piece of code for learning

// Log a welcoming message to the console
console.log("Welcome to JavaScript!");  // Welcome to JavaScript!

// Perform and display a simple mathematical operation
console.log(5 * 5);  // 25

// Combine strings together
console.log("Coding" + " is" + " awesome!");  // Coding is awesome!
