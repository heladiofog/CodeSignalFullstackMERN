# Problem
Stellar Navigator, we have a bug on our hands! Your online shopping platform 
should greet visitors, but it seems a bit too quiet. Could you locate the source 
of the silence and turn it into a friendly welcome? Test and tweak the system 
so that we deliver our greeting to our shoppers effectively.

## Note:
It is not specified, but solution requieres to only focus on backend response for
this particular exercise. It's only mentiond in comments :(
