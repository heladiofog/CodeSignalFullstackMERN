# Problem
Good work, *Stellar Navigator*! Now, let's make a small adjustment. Modify 
the provided Express server code to delete the first post from your blog, 
rather than deleting via a presently provided `id`.

**Hint**: Instead of locating the post by using `id`, simply remove the first 
post from the array.

Keep exploring!


## Ojo con las instrucciones incompletas:
The task requires you to modify the server code to delete only the first post 
using shift(), without retaining the id-based deletion logic.
