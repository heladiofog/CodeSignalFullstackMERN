# Problem
Galactic Pioneer, it's time to put everything together. In this task, you'll create an Express `server` that can respond with the list of planets when a GET request is made to `/api/some-endpoint`. This entails setting up a server, connecting to MongoDB, listening on port `5000`, and handling errors gracefully.

While working on your solution, you'll apply your knowledge of creating an Express instance, defining routes, and connecting to a MongoDB database. Pay careful attention to error handling in your routes to ensure a robust server.
