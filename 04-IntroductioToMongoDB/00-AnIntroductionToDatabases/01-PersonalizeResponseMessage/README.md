# Problem
Galactic Pioneer, your mission is to update the server's response message to be 
more personalized. Instead of saying, `"The stars are bright tonight!"` have the 
server send back a message that speaks directly to our space explorers. Change 
the response message to `"Welcome, Space Explorer! The cosmos awaits you."`.
