# Problem
Observant Space Explorer! Mission control has sent us a piece of code intending to list the planets sorted from closest to farthest from the Sun. However, it seems the spacecraft's dashboard isn't displaying them as expected. Your task is to investigate the backend code and correct the issue so our space data can be properly organized. Your efforts will help guide us through the stars!
