# Problem
Good day, Space Voyager!

We need to ensure our database contains only planets bigger than Earth. We want to delete all the planets with `mass` greater than 1, but something seems to be wrong with our current code, as it is deleting the wrong planets. Can you identify and fix this issue to maintain our cosmic database accurately?
