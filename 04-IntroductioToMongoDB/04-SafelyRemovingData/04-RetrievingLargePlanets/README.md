# Problem
Stellar Navigator, your final mission is to write an endpoint that handles the deletion of a celestial body from our database. You have seen how it's done; now, venture forth and write the code from scratch.

Remember, you're setting sail from port 5000 and targeting the planets in our cosmic database for deletion. Good luck, and may your code be as clear as the night sky!
