# Problem
Stellar Navigator, we have encountered a glitch in our banking system's security feature â€“ it allows users to log in even when the credentials are incorrect.

Your mission is to debug the case and fix the login logic in the server code.

Feel free to use the credentials `username: starSeeker` and `password: treasure` to test the UI preview's login feature manually.
