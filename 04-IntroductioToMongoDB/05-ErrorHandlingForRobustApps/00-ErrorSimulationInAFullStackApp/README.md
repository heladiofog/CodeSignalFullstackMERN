# Problem
In the code below, you'll find a simulation of a robotic server error for Stellar 
Navigator. This server attempts to carry out a task, but something goes awry! 
Notice how the `try...catch` block is utilized to gracefully handle the error. 
On the client side, error handling is also implemented for the response. Click 
`Run` to observe how the server-side error is managed and communicated back to 
our robotics interface!
