# Problem
Alright, Stellar Navigator, let's apply that new knowledge! In the given code, 
the function `getRobotStatus()` on the backend server performs successfully, but 
what if it throws an error? Let's explicitly throw an error in this function via 
`throw new Error(<error message>)`, and see how the error is handled on our 
server and on the client side!
