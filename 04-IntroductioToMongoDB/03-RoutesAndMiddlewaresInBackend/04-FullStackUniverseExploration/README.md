# Problem
Stellar Navigator, you've journeyed through the coding cosmos and learned much 
about Express.js middleware and routes. It's time to cement your knowledge by 
creating a new gateway for planetary details! Write server-side code to log 
request details and a route for sending planet information. Then, on the client 
side, send a request to your server to display a planet's status. Are you ready 
to embark on this final quest?
